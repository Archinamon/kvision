I've just released KVision 0.0.11.

Changelog:

- Support for [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/3/) and possibly other custom CSS themes (Bootstrap 3 compatible).
- Add support for Bootstrap navbar component.
- Add suport for context menu component, which can be enabled on any widget.
- Add Bootstrap toolbar and button group components.
- Add Bootstrap progress bar component.
- Add simple HTML iframe component.
- Add full-featured file upload component based on [Bootstrap file input](http://plugins.krajee.com/file-input).
- Add [Handlebar.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates support for all text widgets.
- Add support for plain HTML form attributes (method, action, enctype, target, ...).
- Many other various enhancements and bug fixes.

The [examples](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision-examples) were also updated. The [Address book](https://rjaros.github.io/kvision-examples/addressbook/)
example uses Material-like CSS theme and the [Showcase](https://rjaros.github.io/kvision-examples/showcase/) example presents all new
features and components in action.
