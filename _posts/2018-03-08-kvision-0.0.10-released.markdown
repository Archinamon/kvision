I've just released KVision 0.0.10.

Changelog:

- support for more CSS properties including text, font, float and clear
- changes to the DataContainer component
- changes to the StackPanel component
- add focus() and blur() methods to all form controls

I've also published a new example - an address book application. It shows how to present data in a table view with 
sorting and searching functionality, and also presents basic usage of KVision forms. You can find the 
[sources](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision-examples/tree/master/addressbook) on GitHub and live demo
is available [here](https://rjaros.github.io/kvision-examples/addressbook/). 

I plan to write KVision tutorial based on this application soon.
