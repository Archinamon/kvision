I've just released KVision 0.0.12.

Changelog:
- some fixes in navigation bar component
- added support for dropdowns without caret icon
- some other minor fixes and enhancements

There is also a new example - a very simple desktop application with three mini apps - a calculator, 
a text editor and a web browser. You can find the 
[sources](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision-examples/tree/master/desktop) on GitHub and live demo
is available [here](https://rjaros.github.io/kvision-examples/desktop/).
